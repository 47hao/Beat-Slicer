BEAT SLICER
by Andrew Zhao
A block slicing rhythm game, where players use motion tracking controls to swing their arms 
and slash through cubes that fly towards them in lanes, all in rhythm with music.

SETUP
CHECK SOUND FOLDER (in FINAL)
If sound files are missing, that's because they are 151MB, download them from drive and put them
in the already included sounds folder. So the sounds directory should hold four folders which each
hold .wav files.
